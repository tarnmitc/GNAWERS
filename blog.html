<p>The purpose of the video
	The purpose of the video is to show there is help out there that killing yourself is not the only option and often a bad one leaving ripple effects and realizing that other people hurt because you are gone</p>
<p>How the video achieves its goal 
	The writer uses a personal narrative with pathos style writing. He appeals to their emotional side and gets the watchers/readers to react.</p> 

<p>The structure of the message
	He starts with a broad topic of how his mother thought about his uncle then moved into a more emotionally charged subject of gay discrimination and suicide. He focused on his uncle’s life then what happened after he was gone. He still addressed and spoke to his late uncle giving the narrative a unique perspective.</p>

<p>In my own writing
	I will use this example of a personal narrative in my paper to appeal more to the story telling perspective and use pathos writing more effectively. I have never written a personal narrative before and did not realize how personal we could get. I will revise my paper and make it more personal. </p>

<p>Analyzing the Correlation between Formal Education and Economic and Personal Success.</p>

<p>I believe that there is no correlation between Formal Education and Personal Success. You are dealt a hand in life and there is not much you can do to control that, but you control all additional hands and where you go from there. There is a correlation between Education and success though. The desire to learn is something you cannot teach and completely self-sustaining. Learning is like opening a door with endless doors after it. I learn about things all the time on the internet like sonoluminescence through educational avenues like youtube and tedtalks. I thought “wow sonoluminescence is really cool I wonder how it is applied.” From there I learned about cavitation. In summery small bubbles in the water that explode hotter than the sun formed by rapid movement of the water and can cause serious damage on things like boat propellers. The point is if you want to be successful in life you will be. Great visionaries like steve jobs, bill gates and mark zuckerberg did not finish college because they saw these doors, walked through them and just kept on walking. So now I ask myself why I am here. I want to be a CRNA in the US Army a practicing doctor needs a degree. So in somecases yes you need school to land a job and make money contributing to personal success but most times no you do not. You need to be driven by the desire to learn and not be faulted by failure. </p>
