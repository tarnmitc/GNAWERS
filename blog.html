The purpose of the video
	The purpose of the video is to show there is help out there that killing yourself is not the only option and often a bad one leaving ripple effects and realizing that other people hurt because you are gone
How the video achieves its goal 
	The writer uses a personal narrative with pathos style writing. He appeals to their emotional side and gets the watchers/readers to react. 

The structure of the message
	He starts with a broad topic of how his mother thought about his uncle then moved into a more emotionally charged subject of gay discrimination and suicide. He focused on his uncleâ€™s life then what happened after he was gone. He still addressed and spoke to his late uncle giving the narrative a unique perspective.

In my own writing
	I will use this example of a personal narrative in my paper to appeal more to the story telling perspective and use pathos writing more effectively. I have never written a personal narrative before and did not realize how personal we could get. I will revise my paper and make it more personal.
